    <h4>
        I have always been passionate about playing vinyl records. There is something incredibly satisfying about placing a record on the turntable, dropping the needle, and immersing myself in the sound. Over the years, this has become more than just a way to listen to music, it has a full-fledged hobby. One of my favorite aspects of collecting vinyl is exploring record stores, each with its own unique selection and atmosphere.<br><br>

        On a recent trip to Melbourne, I couldn't resist checking out some record stores and comparing them. Since Melbourne is a large city with a thriving music culture, I focused on two areas known for their eclectic music scenes: Fitzroy and Collingwood. Both neighborhoods have a grungy, artistic vibe and are home to some of the best independent record stores in the city. At each store, I assessed key factors: the variety of music available, pricing (a big one, since vinyl is getting pricey), the quality of merchandise, and finally the overall vibe as store ambience played a big role in my experience. A well-curated, inviting space makes me want to stay longer and truly explore. Some stores had a diverse selection across genres, while others specialized in niche collections. Price points varied, with some offering affordable second-hand finds and others focusing on high-end releases.<br><br>

        Melbourne is such a vibrant, artistic city, making it a perfect spot for record collectors. If you're ever in town, I highly recommend checking out some of the stores I visited. There are so many options, so I hope my reviews help narrow down the best spots.
