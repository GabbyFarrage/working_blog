            Northside Records is small but packed with great music! Despite its size, it had an impressive selection of vinyl, catering to a wide range of tastes. I was particularly impressed by the variety, which included classic rock, local Aussie artists, Japanese releases, Latin American music, and even movie soundtracks. It is always exciting to find a store that goes beyond the usual mainstream offerings and introduces customers to unique, hard-to-find records.<br><br>
            Located in central Fitzroy, the store is easy to access and situated in a lively area filled with other cool shops, cafés, and bars. This makes it a great stop if you're spending a day exploring the neighborhood. However, since it's in such a busy area, the store itself can feel a little crowded and more on the expensive side. The ambience was decent, but the limited space made it slightly less enjoyable to browse at a relaxed pace. If you prefer a more spacious and laid-back shopping experience, this might be something to keep in mind. There was a discounted section, but unfortunately, most of those records weren't in the best condition, so the savings didn't feel worthwhile. That being said, if you're looking for something specific or a rare find, it might be worth the splurge.

            Searchers Records was a fantastic find and easily one of my favorite record stores in Fitzroy. Unlike some of the more cramped record shops in the area, this one felt much more spacious, making for a more enjoyable browsing experience. The open layout allowed me to take my time flipping through records without feeling rushed or squeezed between other customers. The overall vibe of the store was much more relaxed, which made the shopping experience even better. <br><br>
            Everything in this store was easy to find, which is something I really appreciate. It had a solid range of classic records, covering all the essential genres like rock, jazz, blues, and soul, as well as a decent selection of local and indie artists. If you're someone who enjoys digging through crates but also values a bit of structure, this place strikes a great balance. Another big plus was the discount section. Unlike some stores where sale vinyl is overpriced or in poor condition, Searchers Records had a genuinely great bargain bin, with records going for as low as $10 bucks! There were some surprisingly good finds in there, making it a great spot for collectors on a budget.

            Plug Seven Records offers a cozy and inviting atmosphere for vinyl collectors. Although the store is on the smaller side, it feels surprisingly spacious and is well laid out. While the selection here isn't as large as other stores in the area, it makes up for it with a strong focus on classic rock. If you're a fan of timeless artists from the '60s, '70s, and '80s, this store is definitely worth a visit. However, if you're looking for a wide range of international records or more niche genres, you might find the selection a bit limited. That being said, the well-curated collection ensures that most records in stock are solid picks rather than filler. <br><br>
            One downside is that Plug Seven doesn't have a dedicated discount section, which might be disappointing for bargain hunters. However, the regular pricing is quite reasonable compared to some other stores, so you can still find good deals without feeling like you're overpaying. I really enjoyed the cozy and comfortable feel of this store. While the selection isn't the most diverse, the focus on classic rock and the welcoming layout make it a great place to explore for anyone looking to add some timeless records to their collection.

            Happy Valley Records offers a unique shopping experience, blending vinyl with books, knick-knacks, and other collectibles. While this mix creates a cool and eclectic atmosphere, it's not the ideal spot if you're solely on the hunt for vinyl. The multi-purpose nature of the store means it attracts a wider crowd, making it feel a bit busier and less focused compared to dedicated record stores. <br>
            The selection leans more toward modern albums, setting it apart from other Fitzroy stores. If you're into newer releases, indie pressings, or contemporary artists, there's a solid collection. Classic rock, jazz, and older records are more limited. Prices were slightly higher due to the focus on modern vinyl, but still reasonable. There was a discount section, though most had imperfections like sleeve damage or scratching. That might not matter to collectors focused on the music, but it's worth noting if you want records in perfect condition. The broader focus on books and gifts made the vinyl feel secondary, which could be a downside for serious collectors.

            Unlike traditional record stores that carry a mix of genres, Soundmerch specializes in vinyl and merchandise from iconic contemporary bands, particularly local favorites like King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Amyl and The Sniffers, and The Murlocs etc. If you're into these artists or want to explore the sounds shaping Melbourne's music culture, this store is a goldmine. However, if you're looking for older classics or a wide variety of genres, the selection here may feel limited. <br><br>
            That said, Soundmerch offers a truly enjoyable shopping experience. The store is well laid out, with clean displays and plenty of space to browse without feeling cramped. It's a decent size shop that balances open layout with cozy, curated energy. While some of the pricing can feel a bit steep, it makes sense considering the niche selection and artist-focused merchandise. You're paying for quality and exclusivity, especially with items tied directly to well-known local acts. For fans of modern Australian music or collectors looking for limited edition pressings and merch, Soundmerch is well worth the visit — both for what it offers and the vibe it delivers.
